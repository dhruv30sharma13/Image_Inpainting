# Image_Inpainting
Project to implement image inpainting on masked images.

Used https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/theblackmamba31/landscape-image-colorization, kaggles landscape images for training. Created dataset for this specific project, by applying masks,
randomly generated by opencv on downloaded images.

Frameworks/libraries used:
  -Pytorch
    to make the complete GAN model (generator and discrimminator), define reconstruction loss function, train using pixelwise and adversarial loss.
  -OpenCV
    To deal with all the images, apply masks to images an downloaded dataset
  -Matplotlib and Seaborn
    To plot the graphs of generator and discriminator loss functions wrt number of iterations passes
  -Numpy
    To perform mathematical operations on the image array like, creating masks, multiplying masks with predictions etc
